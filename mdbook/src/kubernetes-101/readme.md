# Getting started with Kubernetes

We will get started by following the `Kubernetes Basics` from the official documentation which is hosted at [Kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io)

This tutorial provides a walkthrough of the basics of the Kubernetes cluster orchestration system.

> This is an important module to understand and cover because Kubernetes has many technical terms and commands that may be new to the participants.

Each module contains some background information on major Kubernetes features and concepts and includes an **interactive online tutorial**. This is great for practicing the basics. Did we mention that this is available to all without any charges so you can practice it whenever you feel like it?

These interactive tutorials let you manage a simple cluster and its containerized applications for yourself.
