# Importing virtual machines

The students need to import two virtual machines for docker labs

1. `docker-student.ova`
2. `docker-ctf.ova`

> **NOTE**: In case of `VBOX_E_FILE_ERROR (0x80BB0004)` error during VM import, ensure you are importing a VM with file extension `.ova`.


## Download VM

| VM Name | Source URL |
|---------|------------|
| docker-student.ova | http://www.mediafire.com/file/3x1tgszet5blaz9/docker-student.ova.zip/file |
| docker-ctf.ova | http://www.mediafire.com/file/39e1w5wt7tmxr43/docker-ctf.ova/file |

## Test Setup

### Ensure Networking within VM

> Ensure you are able to `ping` one VM from the other.
