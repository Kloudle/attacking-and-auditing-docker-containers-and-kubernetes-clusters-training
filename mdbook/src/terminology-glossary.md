# Kubernetes Glossary

### Annotation

A key-value pair that is used to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to objects


### Cluster

A set of machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes

## Container

A lightweight and portable executable image that contains software and all of its dependencies

### Container Environment Variables

Container environment variables are name=value pairs that provide useful information into containers running in a Pod

## Controller

A control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state

## CustomResourceDefinition

Custom code that defines a resource to add to your Kubernetes API server without building a complete custom server

## DaemonSet

Ensures a copy of a Pod is running across a set of nodes in a cluster 

## Deployment

An API object that manages a replicated application

## Extensions

Extensions are software components that extend and deeply integrate with Kubernetes to support new types of hardware

## Image

Stored instance of a container that holds a set of software needed to run an application

## Init Container

One or more initialization containers that must run to completion before any app containers run

## Job

A finite or batch task that runs to completion

## Kubectl

A command line tool for communicating with a Kubernetes API server

## Kubelet

An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a pod

## Kubernetes API

The application that serves Kubernetes functionality through a RESTful interface and stores the state of the cluster

## Label

Tags objects with identifying attributes that are meaningful and relevant to users

## Minikube

A tool for running Kubernetes locally

## Name

A client-provided string that refers to an object in a resource URL, such as /api/v1/pods/some-name

## Namespace

An abstraction used by Kubernetes to support multiple virtual clusters on the same physical cluster 

## Node

A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes

## Pod

The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. A Pod represents a set of running containers on your cluster

## Pod Security Policy

Enables fine-grained authorization of Pod Priority creation and updates

## RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

Manages authorization decisions, allowing admins to dynamically configure access policies through the Kubernetes API 

## ReplicaSet

ReplicaSet is the next-generation Replication Controller

## Resource Quotas

Provides constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per Namespace 

## Selector

Allows users to filter a list of resources based on labels

## Service

An API object that describes how to access applications, such as a set of Pods , and can describe ports and load-balancers

## Service Account

Provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod 

## StatefulSet

Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods , and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods

## Taint

A key-value pair and an effect to prevent the scheduling of pods on nodes or node groups

## Toleration

A key-value pair and an effect to enable the scheduling of pods on nodes or node groups that have a matching taints 

## UID

A Kubernetes systems-generated string to uniquely identify objects

## Volume

A directory containing data, accessible to the containers in a pod 

## docker

Docker is a software technology providing operating-system-level virtualization also known as containers

## kube-apiserver

Component on the master that exposes the Kubernetes API. It is the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane

## kube-controller-manager

Component on the master that runs controllers 

## kube-proxy

kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in the cluster
